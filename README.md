Open a command line in the dist folder and use the following command

    java -jar decrypter.jar
    
A window will open that will allow you to drag and drop files into it.
If any of the files are encrypted .big files, they will be decrypted and saved in a file in the same directory as the original and with the same name, but appended with a '.d' extension.
